## What is this?

This repository contains corrections and additional annotations to th
Turkish section of the [CHILDES database][http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/].

At present, it contains two subcorpora:
- Aksu - contributed to CHILDES by Ayhan Aksu-Koç. 
- Turkay - by Feyza Türkay

Details of the corpora can be found in [CHILDES
manual][http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/12other.pdf].

This version of the corpora is based on official CHILDES versions
downloaded on 2015-03-02.

*Please see [CHILDES website][http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/] for
proper use of this data.

## Why?

I occasionally use this data, and do various automatic/manual
corrections. Unfortunately, they rarely get mature enough to ask for
inclusion in the original distribution, yet, some of these
modifications can be useful for others, too.
