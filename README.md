# An improved version of the Turkish section of CHILDES database

This repository contains corrections and additional annotations to th
Turkish section of the [CHILDES database](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/).

At present, it contains two subcorpora:
- Aksu - contributed to CHILDES by Ayhan Aksu-Koç. 
- Turkay - by Feyza Türkay

Details of the corpora can be found in [CHILDES
manual](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/12other.pdf).

This version of the corpora is based on official CHILDES versions
downloaded on 2015-03-02.

*Please see [CHILDES website](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/) for proper use of this data.*

## Why?

I occasionally use this data, and need various automatic/manual
corrections. Unfortunately, they rarely get mature enough to ask for
inclusion in the original distribution, yet, some of these
modifications can be useful for others, too.

## Notes on Aksu corpus

A few practical notes on Aksu corpus that is not covered in the manual

- The data collection seems to be based on soliciting responses from
  the children based on a pre-determined set of questions. As a
  result, the vocabulary (and probably the structures) present in both
  child and child-directed utterances are not necessarily very
  representative. For example "ütü" (flatiron) is more frequent than
  "anne" (mother) in this corpus.
- Because of the same reason, most of the child-directed utterances
  are from the experimenter, not from the regular caregivers.
- The files 2ha.cha and 2haf.cha seem to be transcripts of the same
  recording session, although they have some differences.
- The file 6fb.cha has a large section where transcriptions seems to
  have gone wrong. Particularly, the utterances of the experimenter
  (or some other adult) seems to be marked as they belong to the
  child.
